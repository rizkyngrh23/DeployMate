## Installation

```bash
npm install -g deploymate
```

## Usage

1. Create a `deploy.config.json` file in the root of your project:

```json
{
    "provider": "vercel", // Change to "netlify" or "digitalocean" as needed
    "envVariables": {
        "vercel": "VERCEL_TOKEN",
        "netlify": "NETLIFY_TOKEN",
        "digitalocean": "DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN"
    }
}
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with your deployment tokens:

```properties
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
NETLIFY_TOKEN=your_netlify_token
DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_digitalocean_token
```

3. Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to keep your tokens secure:

```gitignore
.vercel
.env
node_modules
```

4. Run the deploy command:

```bash
deploymate
```
